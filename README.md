# Pokémon Copper

This is a ROMhack of Pokémon Crystal.

### Description

Pokémon Copper is not a difficulty hack or a catch-em-all, although it modifies the difficulty of boss trainers and allows for a wider selection of Pokémon. This is a reimagining of the second generation by me, essentially answering the question "What if I was in charge of making the Pokémon games?"

It includes the following features:
- A modified story, that tries to answer some questions that the original games left unanswered
- Bugfixes that attempt to remedy the oddities of Generation 2 battling
- Boss trainer battles and Rival battles have been modified. Regular trainers have been left unmodified.
- Some but not all Pokémon have received a type change, based off their Pokédex entry and if I thought their typing made sense. The intent was to reduce duplicate type fatigue (Normal/Flying is a good example)
- Pokémon stats have been rounded up to the nearest value ending in 0, i.e. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, etc. This was to give every Pokémon a universal small buff.
- All wild encounters have been changed to allow for a greater variety of Pokémon to be captured.
- All Pokémon level-up moves have been changed. Generally, a Pokémon will learn a new move every 5 levels or upon evolution up until a certain level. For example, Moltres originally learned 3 moves by level-up, but now learns 12
- GS Ball and Celebi event restored
- Instant Text scrolling speed option
- Physical/Special Split
